    <h1>1.0.0</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Removed compatibility for all applications except Firefox and
        XULRunner, since they are the only ones regularly tested.  If
        you use MozRepl regularly in other applications and want to
        help test them, please contact hyperstruct [at] gmail [dot]
        com.
      </li>

      <li>
        Added espresso.el, improved javascript mode for Emacs.  See
        wiki for instructions on how to use it.
      </li>
    </ul>
